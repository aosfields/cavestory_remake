1) Open up a MSVC command prompt 
(you can do this on Win 10 by going to the start menu and 
seraching for dev. Click on the Dev command prompt app.
This worked for me so I didn't look at other options.)

Then follow this post on SO to install boost.
http://stackoverflow.com/a/2641513

Unzip Boost into a new directory.
Start a 32-bit MSVC command prompt and change to the directory where Boost was unzipped.
Run: bootstrap
Run: b2 toolset=msvc-17.0 --build-type=complete --libdir=C:\Boost\lib\i386 install
	For Visual Studio 2012, use toolset=msvc-11.0
	For Visual Studio 2010, use toolset=msvc-10.0
Add C:\Boost\include\boost-(version) to your include path. (VC C++ Directories Include Section)
Add C:\Boost\lib\i386 to your libs path. (VC C++ Directories Library Section)

Since this tutorial was using the 32 bit SDL libraries as well
I decided to use Boost 32 bit for now.
